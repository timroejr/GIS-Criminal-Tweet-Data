# About
Using [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) along with the use of the
[Parse Server SDK](https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server) and
some backend and client side code we were able to convert raw Twitter
data in the form of a JSON file which automatically and efficiently
saves each tweet as an object in stored in a MongoDB Database. This data
then can be shown on a Map with both Crime Data and Tweet Data combined.
